/**
 * Core capability system for defining graph database write permissions.
 *
 * The Capabilities interface provides a **unified abstraction** for managing
 * write permissions across different deployment scenarios:
 *
 * **Deployment Scenarios:**
 *
 * 1. **LOCAL Mode**: Direct database access
 *    - In-process database operations
 *    - Maximum performance, full control
 *    - Single-node or embedded deployments
 *
 * 2. **REMOTE Mode**: Network-based database access
 *    - Client-server communication
 *    - Distributed deployments
 *    - Network latency considerations
 *
 * 3. **NONE Mode**: Read-only operations
 *    - Analysis and query workloads
 *    - Safe mode for production systems
 *    - Prevents accidental modifications
 *
 * **Security Model:**
 * The capability system provides **compile-time safety** by requiring
 * explicit capability checks before performing write operations.
 *
 * **Performance Implications:**
 * - LOCAL: Direct memory access, optimal performance
 * - REMOTE: Network overhead, batching optimizations needed
 * - NONE: No write overhead, maximum read performance
 *
 * **Usage Pattern:**
 * ```typescript
 * function performWrite(capabilities: Capabilities, data: GraphData): void {
 *   if (capabilities.canWriteToLocalDatabase()) {
 *     // Direct, high-performance local write
 *     writeToLocalDatabase(data);
 *   } else if (capabilities.canWriteToRemoteDatabase()) {
 *     // Network-aware remote write with batching
 *     writeToRemoteDatabase(data);
 *   } else {
 *     throw new Error('Write operations not permitted');
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Integration Points:**
 * - Graph loading pipelines
 * - Algorithm result persistence
 * - Backup and migration tools
 * - Development vs production environments
 */
export interface Capabilities {

   * Get the write mode for this capability configuration.
   *
   * The write mode determines how graph modifications are handled:
   * - LOCAL: Direct database access for maximum performance
   * - REMOTE: Network-based access for distributed deployments
   * - NONE: Read-only mode for safe analysis operations
   *
   * @returns The configured write mode
   */
  writeMode(): WriteMode;

  /**
   * Check if local database writes are permitted.
   *
   * Local writes provide **maximum performance** through direct memory access
   * and are optimal for:
   * - High-throughput loading operations
   * - In-process analytics pipelines
   * - Single-node deployments
   * - Development and testing environments
   *
   * **Performance Characteristics:**
   * - **Latency**: Sub-microsecond for simple operations
   * - **Throughput**: Limited only by memory bandwidth
   * - **Consistency**: Immediate consistency within process
   * - **Scalability**: Vertical scaling within single machine
   *
   * **Use Cases:**
   * ```typescript
   * if (capabilities.canWriteToLocalDatabase()) {
   *   // Direct adjacency list updates
   *   graph.addRelationship(sourceId, targetId, properties);
   *
   *   // Bulk loading with memory optimization
   *   bulkLoader.loadFromStream(dataStream);
   *
   *   // Algorithm result materialization
   *   pageRankResults.writeToGraph(graph);
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * @returns true if local database writes are permitted
   */
  canWriteToLocalDatabase(): boolean;

  /**
   * Check if remote database writes are permitted.
   *
   * Remote writes enable **distributed deployments** but require careful
   * optimization for network efficiency:
   * - Batching small operations for network efficiency
   * - Compression for large data transfers
   * - Retry logic for network resilience
   * - Asynchronous operations for throughput
   *
   * **Performance Characteristics:**
   * - **Latency**: Milliseconds due to network round-trips
   * - **Throughput**: Network bandwidth limited, batching critical
   * - **Consistency**: Eventual consistency across network
   * - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple machines
   *
   * **Optimization Strategies:**
   * ```typescript
   * if (capabilities.canWriteToRemoteDatabase()) {
   *   // Batch operations for network efficiency
   *   const batch = new RemoteWriteBatch();
   *   relationships.forEach(rel => batch.add(rel));
   *   await batch.execute(); // Single network round-trip
   *
   *   // Compress large transfers
   *   const compressedData = compress(largeDataSet);
   *   await remoteDatabase.bulkLoad(compressedData);
   *
   *   // Asynchronous pipeline for throughput
   *   const pipeline = new AsyncWritePipeline(remoteDatabase);
   *   pipeline.write(data1);
   *   pipeline.write(data2); // Overlapped with previous write
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * **Network Optimization:**
   * - **Batching**: Combine multiple operations to reduce round-trips
   * - **Compression**: Reduce bandwidth usage for large transfers
   * - **Pipelining**: Overlap network and compute operations
   * - **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data locally
   *
   * @returns true if remote database writes are permitted
